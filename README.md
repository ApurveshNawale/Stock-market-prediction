# Stock-market-prediction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices based on historical market data. It is designed for data enthusiasts, financial analysts, and anyone interested in leveraging predictive modeling to make informed investment decisions.


## Overview 
this project aims to predict future stock prices by analyzing historical price data. It employs machine learning models to forecast daily opening, closing, high, and low prices for stocks.

Getting Started

To use this stock prediction tool, simply clone the repository and ensure the required libraries are installed.

## Prerequisites
You will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (if using neural network models)



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisandresgarcia/stock-market-prediction)



## Models Used
 Machine learning models used for stock market prediction
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Linear Regression
 - Random Forest Regression

## Usage/Examples
An example usage would be:

    1.Import historical stock price data from CSV files in the data/ folder 
    2.Process data and engineer features
    3.Train machine learning models like LSTM, ARIMA, random forests on the data
    4.Make predictions for future stock prices
See the notebook for full examples.
